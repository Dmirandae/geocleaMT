To obtain the occurrences reported for the Biogeographic Choco in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) (Telenius2011), we will go to GBIF website and follow the next pathway:


```
>  Data
>  Explore occurences (Fig. 1)
```

```
>  Georeferenced records
>  Add a filter
>  Location (Fig. 2)
```

```
>  Location Box
>  Draw tools: Undefined (Fig. 3)
```

Then, we draw the area of interest (in our case, The  Biogeographic Choco form (_sensu lato:_ Hernandez-Camacho et al 1992), see Fig. 3), and click on:

```
> Apply
```

We will download a specific taxon using again the `add filter' tool. For example, we will download all occurrences of mammals reported by  GBIF for The  Biogeographic Choco (Fig. 3-4), as was used in the example in R-Alarcon and Miranda-Esquivel (submitted).

For this example, we will use a selection of 35 species from the 
example in R-Alarcon and Miranda-Esquivel (submitted). These 35 species
are the best candidates because they present all possible issues we can face in a standard dataset.

The best file format to download is as a zip file, because it brings the complete information in the Darwin Core Standard (Wieczorek et al. 2012).
 Keep in mind that you must be registered at  GBIF website.

After download the zip file, we have a folder with some information files. The file which have the occurrences data is the called `occurrences.text'. If you want to read it, note that the separator is TAB.
