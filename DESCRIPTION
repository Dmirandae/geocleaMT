Package: geocleaMT
Description: This package is a cleaning protocol for distributional data and an
    automated tool to provide the necessary data mining process before any diversity
    analysis. The protocol takes into account the most common mistakes found in
    distributional records and attempts to minimize its possibility, increasing
    users confidence in their data. All functions use as input a basic table with
    at least three columns species / decimalLatitude/ decimalLongitude, and save
    the results in the same format after a specific task is performed. Additionally,
    all functions return a descriptive report about the process made, that can be
    also saved as data frame object. Although, the functions could be used in the
    suggested pipelines, each function is suited to perform an specific task or a
    set of them, given the package a high level of customizability. See R-Alarcon
    and Miranda-Esquivel (submitted).
